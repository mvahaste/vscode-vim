# Make VS Code on Windows feel more like Vim

Extensions and settings that make using VS Code faster and feel more like Vim, along with some visual changes.

The CSS (`custom.css`) should work with any color theme, but can be easily modified to better suit your needs by adjusting the root variables at the top of the file.

## Features

-  Edit files, switch tabs and groups, toggle integrated terminal, navigate, create, rename, and delete files, etc. with keyboard shortcuts.
-  Maximize screen space by hiding many of the non-essential UI elements.
-  Cool (ðŸ˜Ž) background blur on different widgets.
-  And more QoL improvements.

## Installation

1. Install the extensions listed below (also the font if you want to use the same one, but it can be easily changed).
2. Copy the contents of `settings.json` to your VS Code `settings.json`.
3. Copy the contents of `keybindings.json` to your VS Code `keybindings.json`.
4. Add the path to the `custom.css` file into your `settings.json`.
5. If you want fast virtual desktop switching on Windows, install AutoHotkey and the script from the link below, then replace the `user_config.ahk` with the one in the repo.
