# Make VS Code on Windows feel more like Vim

Extensions and settings that make using VS Code faster and feel more like Vim, along with some visual changes.

The CSS (`custom.css`) should work with any color theme, but can be easily modified to better suit your needs by adjusting the root variables at the top of the file.

I also use this repo to back up some configs for myself, so not everything here will be useful/relevant to others (terminal prompt, browser settings, etc.)

## Features

-   Edit files, switch tabs and groups, toggle integrated terminal, navigate, create, rename, and delete files, etc. with keyboard shortcuts.
-   Maximize screen space by hiding many of the non-essential UI elements.
-   Cool (ðŸ˜Ž) background blur on different widgets.
-   And more QoL improvements.

1. Install the extensions listed below (also the font if you want to use the same one, but it can be easily changed).
2. Copy the contents of `vsc_settings.json` into your VS Code `settings.json`.
3. Copy the contents of `vsc_keybindings.json` into your VS Code `keybindings.json`.
4. Add the path to the `custom.css` file into your `settings.json`.
5. If you want the Vesper theme for Windows Terminal, copy the contents of `wt_settings.json` into your Windows Terminal `settings.json`
6. If you want my bash settings, copy and append the contents of `bash.bashrc` into your `.bashrc`/`bash.bashrc`.
7. If you want fast virtual desktop switching on Windows, install AutoHotkey and the script from the link below, then replace the `user_config.ahk` with the one in the repo.
